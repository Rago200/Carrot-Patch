# Carrot-Patch
This is a simple game using object oriented principles where the user has to use the rabbit to collect all the carrots and avvoid the wolf. 

# Functionality 
There are many objects and features in the game that needed to be implemented.
The Carrots which are non interactive images. They do not react to the mouse events or to
key pressed by the user. Interactive objects such as buttons rabbits and wolves. These graphic
objects are GUI listeners objects which react to the mouse events or specific key pressed.
They define common properties and common behaviors. But they act differently in the
patch. Each animal/button has a specific behavior indeed.

# Example
